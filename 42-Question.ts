//42.  Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
let magicians = ["Salman", "Faizan", "Asif"]

function ShowMagicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(magician => console.log(magician))
}
ShowMagicians(magicians)

function makeGreatMagicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.map(magician => console.log(`The Great ${magician}`))
}
makeGreatMagicians(magicians)
